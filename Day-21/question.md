### Today's Question:
Santa needs to optimize his sleigh for Christmas deliveries. Write a query to calculate the total weight of gifts for each recipient type (good or naughty) and determine what percentage of the total weight is allocated to each type. Include the recipient_type, total_weight, and weight_percentage in the result.

### Table Schema

|-----------------|--------------|
| gift_id          | INT          |
| gift_name        | TEXT         |
| recipient_type   | TEXT         |
| weight_kg        | FLOAT        |

### Sample Data

| gift_id | gift_name       | recipient_type | weight_kg  |
|---------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| 1       | Toy Train       | good           | 2.5        |
| 2       | Lumps of Coal   | naughty        | 1.5        |
