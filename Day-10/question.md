# Day 10: SQL Advent Calendar

### Today's Question:
You are tracking your friends' New Yearâ€™s resolution progress.  

**Task**:  
Write a query to calculate the following for each friend:  
1. Number of resolutions they made (`total_resolutions`).  
2. Number of resolutions they completed (`completed_resolutions`).  
3. Success percentage (`success_percentage`), calculated as the percentage of completed resolutions.  
4. Success category (`success_category`), based on the success percentage:  
   - **Green**: If success percentage is greater than 75%.  
   - **Yellow**: If success percentage is between 50% and 75% (inclusive).  
   - **Red**: If success percentage is less than 50%.
